# Train Ticket Booking Management System

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
• This project is about creating the database about the Train Reservation System.<br/>
• The train reservation system facilitates the passengers to enquire about the trains available on the basis of source and destination , booking of tickets , enquire about the status of the booked ticket, etc.<br/>
• The aim of this project is to design and develop a database maintaining the records of different trains and passengers. The record of train includes its name, source, destination, timing , seat availability and seat booked.<br/>
• Passengers can book their tickets for the train in which seats are available. For this, passengers have to provide the date for which ticket is to be booked , source and destination station. Before booking a ticket for a passenger, the train availability and booking date is checked. <br/>
• Once the train availability and booking date are validated , it is checked whether the seat is available. If yes, the ticket is booked with the confirm status.<br/>

# List of Assumptions:
•  Since the reservation system is very large in reality, it is not feasible to develop the project to that extent and prepare documentation at that level. Therefore, a small sample case study has been created to demonstrate the working of the reservation system. To implement this sample case study, some assumptions have been made , which are as follows:<br/>
1. The number of trains has been restricted to 4.<br/>
2. The total number of tickets can be booked in each train is 60.<br/>
3. There is no weightage for old or handicapped or women to avoid the complexity.<br/>
4. The waiting list and rac feature is not added in ticket booking system.<br/>

## Approach:

• We have compiled the system's admin requirements and prepared the project's scope and purpose before starting. The outcomes of this phase include the proposed system's features, scope and limitations, objectives, costs and advantages, and user interface design.<br/>
• After researching and identifying the issues with the current system, we created an entity relation diagram (E-R diagram) for the suggested solution.<br/>
• We transformed the E-R diagram into a relational database model based on the analytical phase, a user interface was also designed during this phase.<br/>
• We turned the proposed system's design into computer software, using front-end development like HTML , CSS, JAVASCRIPT , BOOTSTRAP and MySQL for SQL databases (back end), and PHP through VSCODE IDE.<br/>

# Application Development

• The RaspController application allows you to easily manage your Raspberry Pi remotely. Now it is possible for files, to control the GPIO ports, send commands directly through the terminal, view images from a connected camera and obtain data from different sensors. Finally, wiring diagrams, pins and various information are available for the correct use of the Raspberry Pi.

• GPIO Management.<br/>
• CPU, Ram, Storage, Network monitoring.<br/>
• Support for DHT11/22 sensors (Humidity and temperature).<br/>
• Support for DS18B20 sensors (Temperature).<br/>
• Support for BMP sensors (Pressure, temperature, altitude).<br/>


# ThingSpeak

• ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate , visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. You can send data to ThingSpeak from your devices , create instant visualization of live data , and send alerts. ThingSpeak enables engineers and scientists to prototype and build IoT systems without setting up servers or developing web software . It is an open data platform for the internet of things . Your device or application can communicate with ThingSpeak using a RESTful API , and you can either keep your data private or make it public.<br/>

# About Project

## Strenghts

• Data from the sensors can be sent to the web page or app which can be accessed from anywhere in the world.<br/>
• The system is cost-effective and affordable. So that everyone can use it freely.<br/>
• High accuracy, Easy to use.<br/>

## Applications

• Digital temperature monitoring in laboratories.<br/>
• Temperature monitoring in greenhouses.<br/>
• Environment monitoring of warehouses for food safety.<br/>
• Equipment monitoring in factories.<br/>

## Future scope of our Project

• The IOT Based weather Informative System is proposed to Real time Applications. It doesn’t need of any data centers physically because of we are creating a data Server in Cloud so that it doesn’t require any datacenter further. So It Reduces the Cost of Equipment. Many of the Innovative Researchers are interested towards The IOT based Real time Applications. So this System will helps to the Researcher for their further investigation of weather details.<br/>
• The IOT Based Weather Informative System not only displays the weather parameters like Temperature, Altitude, Humidity and Pressure etc., but it also displays the weather location, Industry, Time and other weather information from this we can forecasts the weather details.<br/>
